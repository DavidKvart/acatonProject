# Flight with us project

This project was made in 24 hours during an acaton contest, two months after I began studying coding. 

me and my partner arrived in the first place and won a four-day trip to Europe!

### about the project

in this project you will be able to see the control board from the Ben Gurion airport, we used a live api so you will be able to see a live view.
because the api costs money we closed the subscription and for now you will be able to see a "screenshot" rather than a live view.

### the heart of the project

the heart of the project is the map interaction, by pressing one of the flights on the board you will be able to see the route the flight takes, and where it comes from on the world map.

### live view

the best feature  on the project is the live map view, by pressing the live map on the navbar you will be able to see 

#### all of the flights coming into Israel and were they are on the map.



**Note: to place the plane and routs we needed to use 3 different  api's and since this project is frontend  only we had to render the entire  data for each render**
