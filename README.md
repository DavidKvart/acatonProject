# Flight with us project

This project was made in 24 hours during  an acaton contest , two month after i began studying  coding. 

me and my partner arrived to the first place and won a four day trip to europe!

### about the project

in this project you will be able to see the control board from the ben gurion airport , we used a live api so you will be able to see a live view.
because  the api costs money we closed the subscription and for now you will be able to see a "screen shot" rather then live view.

### the heart of the project

the heart of the project is the map interaction , by pressing one of the flights on the board you will be able to see the route the flight takes , and were it comes from on the world map .

### live view

the best feature  on the project is the live map view, by pressing the live map on the navbar you will be able to see 

#### all of the flights coming into israel and were they are on the map.



**Note: to place the plane and and routs we needed to use 3 different  api's and since this project is frontend  only we had to render the entire  data for each render**
